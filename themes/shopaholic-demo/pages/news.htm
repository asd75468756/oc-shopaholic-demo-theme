            At New York Fashion Week: Men’s, Immigrants, Bitcoin and a Bid for Relevancy

        <span class="uk-text-left"><p>Kinda! Last weekend, Timberlake played the Super Bowl half-time show and exploited a far more talented African-American singer – just like in 2004! But whereas back then this singer was Janet Jackson, whose wardrobe he notoriously malfunctioned, this time it was Prince, with whose image he kinda sorta sang a duet. To show his respect, you see? Indeed, Timberlake has so much respect for Prince that originally he wanted to sing with Prince’s hologram, even though Prince famously referred to the practice of resurrecting dead singers by hologram “demonic”. The mighty Sheila E reportedly put the kibosh on Timbo’s plan but he still sang against what looked like a sheet with Prince on it. And even on a sheet, and dead, Prince still came off a lot better than ol’ Timberlake. Back in 2004, everyone was furious because Timberlake showed the world Jackson’s nipple. A nipple! Can you imagine? The people at the Super Bowl were there to enjoy the wholesome activity of watching grown men giving one another massive head injuries – they did not want to see something as sordid and unnatural as a nipple, OK?</p>

           <p>But of course it isn’t 2004. Possibly the surest way to tell is that people are actually angry with Timberlake this time round. Back then, everyone was angry with Jackson, even though – I shout, running to my blackboard like Kevin Costner in JFK to illustrate the workings of a world-shaking conspiracy – it was TIMBERLAKE who ripped Jackson’s bra off, not blameless JACKSON. And yet it was Jackson who got all the kickback while Timberlake sailed blithely on into a sea of global adulation that lasted nearly a decade.</p></span>
